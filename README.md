# curry-generator
The curry generator from the curry book by Mehnert, Oblig and Schirmer; written in elm.

This is just a little toy to get my hands dirty with the precious elm resin I've been reading so much about ;)

Known Issues:
  - Because all three picks take the same seed we always get the same combination of main ingredient and base. I need to pass the seed from one pick call to another
  - This might need some CSS and translations
